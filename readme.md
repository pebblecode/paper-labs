## paper-labs ##

In order to start learning javascript and because I like making pretty things. I've started playing with [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/)

This repo is going to be a place to collect my experiments. I'd to hear any feeback on these little labs. Please get in contact via github if you've got any questions/sugestions.

Like to say thanks to the people behinds the mind-bendingly awesome guys behind [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) as well as my very helpful colleagues at [pebble {code}](http://pebblecode.com/)
